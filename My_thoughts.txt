For the ADDTOCART, i think it should be a copy paste of the method orderProduct in EcommcersSystem, but instead, instead of ordering the product,
it will be played into a list which is the customer's cart (This could be used via a map, where it maps each's customer's customer id
with their cart's list of items (aka, customer id is linked with the customer's cart, which could be a list).
Something i should do, make a map with customer's id's as a name, and create a list which is mapped to it.


NEED TO HAVE AN ERROR CHECK IF THERE IS NOTHING IN THE CUSTOMER'S CART (EXAMPLE: THROW EMPTY CART EXCEPTIONS:PRINT LINE THERE IS NOTHING IN YOUR CART
