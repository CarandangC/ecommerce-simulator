One bug about the code is that the methods ship and cancel in the userinterface works, but always throws an 
error no matter what happens, which I cannot find out the reason why as the logic does not make sense
(it still throws the error after returning a value). 

ADDTOCART
REMCARTITEM
PRINTCART 
ORDERITEMS
Have all been implemented.

Error messeages have been changed to exceptions
the arraylist products has been implemented as a hashmap
Cart and CartItem classes has been implemented.

In general everthing works as supposed to asides from the bug stated earlier.
